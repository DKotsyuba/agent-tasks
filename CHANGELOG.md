# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Run release checks and payload construction in parallel while keeping publication gated on both.
- Seed separate check/package dependency caches from main; document focused checks for local iteration.
- Reuse Cargo dependency builds and versioned cargo-deny tooling in CI and release jobs.
- Run Clippy/tests once for featureless workspaces; retain both default and all-features configurations when workspace features exist.

### Fixed

- Modern MCP 2026-07-28 tools/list includes a 60000 ms private cache lifetime; legacy catalog responses stay unchanged.
- Raw stdio regression tests cover modern/legacy tools/list and modern server/discover; supported protocol revisions are explicit.

### Added

- Initial agent-tasks working set: the read-only `get_status` identity tool and
  the local development gate.

No published release is implied by the Cargo package version.

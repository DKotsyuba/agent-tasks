//! Pure workflow guidance derived from the authoritative guard rules.
//!
//! Both projections in this module are read-only computations over an already loaded complete
//! Project graph: they reuse [`crate::rules::transition`] and [`crate::rules::discrepancies`]
//! plus the recorded review and integration state, and never contact Linear or Git. There is
//! no second rule system here — every condition shown is produced by the same guards that
//! enforce mutations. [`guidance`] names the single next workflow action for one work item
//! together with the conditions still blocking it. Stage and action names are advisory
//! vocabulary for readers; they never introduce new Linear statuses or bypass the guards.

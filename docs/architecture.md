# Native Linear workflow

## MCP result presentation

The resident HTTP Handler and the stdio Bridge expose the same static catalogue.
Each response follows the caller's own MCP revision, independently of the Bridge's
upstream connection: `2026-07-28` returns `resultType = complete`, `ttlMs = 60000`
and `cacheScope = private`; explicit legacy sessions omit all three fields.
An unknown tool name returns a JSON-RPC `METHOD_NOT_FOUND` protocol error at
the transport boundary. Expected workflow/input rejections remain tool results
with `isError`; the internal Gateway retains its `UNKNOWN_TOOL` Outcome.

All 25 public tool calls share one presentation boundary after the structured Gateway outcome. HTTP and the stdio bridge expose the same single plain-text result block, with no `structuredContent` mirror. `isError` marks blocked, unavailable and uncertain outcomes; it does not mark a confirmed mutation as failed if presentation breaks. Templates and shared macros own labels, headings, conditions and layout; Rust selects structured source values. Assets are embedded at build time, initialize once, use strict undefined values and disable HTML escaping, bound template recursion (16) and execution fuel, and render into a private bounded buffer. No user template files or raw-output mode are loaded. The documented reply budget is 2 MiB (`render::TEXT_BUDGET_BYTES`), deliberately larger than the family default because exact full Document and context reads are part of this product's contract: a reply that cannot fit is refused with the truthful status-preserving fallback line, never silently truncated.

Mutation responses confirm the native ID or URL, status and replay state without echoing submitted descriptions and reports; a check-only status call is labelled as a preview. Reads retain actionable UUIDs and URLs, exact pagination and overview cursors, transition conditions, unresolved questions and current evidence. Issue context preserves native description and unknown human prose, then adds distinct checkout, parent, child, document and review details. A Module also retains its usable PR draft, notes and full source commit IDs. When both saved and current native result/check sections exactly match the derived report, the two duplicate known sections are omitted from the separate description; manual sections remain. A pending write includes the exact original tool and arguments needed for safe replay, without the internal before/next snapshots. Explicit document and comment reads preserve requested bodies in full; thread resolution comes from the root comment. Full and delta overviews retain the unpublished ProjectUpdate draft once. Deltas describe changed fields and direct the reader to full context when a change extends beyond a preview; no raw hashes are printed. A rendering defect produces a short status-preserving recovery line and advises inspection before another mutation.

A Document read and save acknowledgement identify the Document itself even when native data includes an Issue or Project ownership link. A comment thread shows a selected reply once, alongside other replies. Page responses show the opaque next cursor only when `hasNextPage` is true.

## Data model

A native Project is a permanent product container. Epic, Module, Task and Atomic are native Issues distinguished by `EPIC`, `MODULE`, `TASK`, `ATOMIC` labels. Existing exact team/workspace labels are reused; missing labels are created. No custom workflow statuses, control Issues, companion Issues or Initiatives are created.

```text
Project
├── Epic
│   ├── Module
│   │   ├── Task
│   │   └── Atomic
│   └── Atomic
├── Module
│   ├── Task
│   └── Atomic
└── Atomic
```

Project creation also creates native `Runbook` and `Решения` documents. Requirements/contracts live in issue descriptions. Further documents are explicit. Native issues are the TODO list; Linear history is the change log.

## Public data fields

Managed fields own recognized level-two CommonMark sections only. Fenced and indented code headings stay literal; unknown sections and prose retain their source bytes. `sections::level_two_sections` exposes exact heading/body/end spans; `records::read_fields` rejects duplicate real fields, and `patch_description` returns a validation error before changing ambiguous content. Nested prose headings should use level three or deeper.

Create calls require `request_id`, `actor`, `title`, `project_id` and `team_id`; Task also requires `parent_id`. Issue titles are stored with exactly one leading kind marker (`[EPIC]`, `[MODULE]`, `[TASK]`, `[ATOMIC]`); repeated or wrong recognized markers are normalized, unrelated markers such as `[UI]` are preserved, and a marker without a title is rejected. Project titles remain unchanged. Issue `priority` is native Linear priority: 0 none, 1 urgent, 2 high, 3 medium, 4 low. Omitted create priority is 0; omitted edit priority preserves the native value and 0 clears it. Issue fields may be prepared in Backlog/Todo. Project creation instead requires `team_id`, `title` and `description`; both `repository_path` and `repository_url` are optional for planning. A supplied path must be an absolute existing local Git checkout; the optional external URL accepts HTTP(S), including non-GitHub hosts. Legacy URL-only calls remain valid.

Issue create/edit calls accept a `fields` object. Omitted values are preserved; null removes a nullable value. `work_type` defaults to `code` for Module/Task/Atomic and `non_code` for Epic. Use `non_code` explicitly for document/administrative work and `integration` for an integration Atomic. Reference fields accept UUIDs or the native Linear permalinks of the agreed input matrix; permalinks are resolved and stored as normalized UUIDs. Permalink resolution rolls out with the coordinated runtime release — earlier v2 runtimes accept every UUID input unchanged.

| Fields | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `description`, `scope` | Readable explanation and boundaries |
| `business_requirements` | Epic business need |
| `expected_result`, `acceptance_criteria` | Observable outcome and acceptance |
| `required_contract`, `provided_contract` | Module contract description/link or explicit “not required” |
| `lead`, `executor`, `session_url` | Session reference such as `codex:…` or `agent-run:…`, optional real transcript URL |
| `repository_path`, `repository_url`, `branch`, `worktree` | Local repository, optional external link and execution checkout; Task inherits from Module |
| `local_check` | Planned local verification |
| `result`, `check_result` | Actual outcome and check summary |
| `commit_url`, `artifact_url` | Code commit or non-code result link |
| `pr_url`, `merge_report` | Module review target and reported merge |
| `after_epic` | Optional prerequisite Epic reference (UUID or native Linear permalink) for a Project-level Module; resolved and stored as its UUID |
| `integration_modules`, `scenarios`, `environment` | Participating Module references (UUIDs or native Linear permalinks; resolved and stored as UUIDs) and actual interaction checks |
| `reason`, `duplicate_of` | Retirement reason and original issue URL |

Descriptions have readable Russian level-two section headings. Use level-three or deeper headings inside field values. Unrelated sections/prose remain intact during partial edits. A manually changed description is reported; a content edit can adopt the current recognized fields after full schema validation. Title/priority-only edits do not send or adopt descriptions and preserve review identity, results and revision, including while In Review or Done. Native Markdown escaping, link formatting and `-`/`*` unordered list markers are accounted for without removing unrelated prose. A CommonMark parser identifies actual list boundaries, which remain distinct from escaped literal markers and code contents. Unparsed backticks conservatively disable marker folding. When a requested bare URL becomes a native titled link at the same text position, confirmation compares its unchanged destination without treating the generated title as an edit. This holds even when closing punctuation directly follows the bare URL — end of text, whitespace, closing prose punctuation, or a period that starts no alphanumeric continuation — mirroring where Linear closes generated links; only an alphanumeric continuation keeps the trailing text outside the link. A bare prose domain may likewise become a same-label `http://` link at that same boundary. Explicitly different labels, changed destinations, code literals and extra prose still conflict.

`repository_path` uses the dedicated `Локальный репозиторий` section. Project edits preserve omitted fields and documents; null removes either repository field. Adding a path preserves old prose in `Репозиторий`. Modules and code Atomics outside Modules inherit omitted repository fields at creation; only valid external URLs are inherited from that legacy section. Existing work can be updated explicitly with `edit_module`/`edit_atomic`; later Project edits do not rewrite existing work. Task and nested Atomic context includes the current Module repository path, URL, branch, worktree and lead.

`edit_project(content, expected_updated_at)` replaces the whole Project passport body instead of one targeted field, under the same guarded-write shape as a Document: `content` is rejected together with any of `title`/`description`/`repository_path`/`repository_url` in the same call — combine at most one targeted field set or one whole-body replace, never both. A missing `expected_updated_at` is `PRECONDITION_REQUIRED`; a byte-identical `content` (via the same Markdown-equivalence comparison used elsewhere) confirms `replayed: true` with no write, even before checking the precondition. Otherwise the current native `updatedAt` is compared to `expected_updated_at`; a mismatch is `PENDING_CONFLICT` — the concurrent edit is preserved, never overwritten — and only a match proceeds to one write, confirmed before being returned. There is no native compare-and-swap here either: this precondition only catches drift this same reader already observed.

Supplied local paths are validated before create/edit writes. Starting a Module or standalone code Atomic requires a local path or legacy URL. With `repository_path`, readiness also validates its worktree. Normal repositories and linked worktrees are accepted; missing, relative, non-Git and bare directories are rejected. Validation runs only local `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, without shell interpolation, with bounded output and a two-second process deadline. Git must be installed on the gateway host. Context and check-only transition calls use the same read-only readiness check. URL-only legacy records retain field-based readiness; supplying a local path opts into local checks. Branch remains a required declared field. Planning and non-code work need no repository.

The Rust `git::read_commit(path, hash)` reader accepts an unambiguous hexadecimal object hash (4–64 digits), never a branch or revision expression. Each Git process has a two-second deadline and a 64 KiB stdout limit. It reads the commit object's exact UTF-8 message, resolves the full SHA, and records the canonical common Git directory so linked worktrees share an identity. Git replacement objects and inherited repository overrides are ignored. No Git writes or network operations occur. The message requires a Conventional Commit subject and nonempty `Result:` and `Checks:` sections; `Notes:` is optional. Original text, Git author/date and structured sections are returned as `git::GitCommit`. Checks remain the author's report, not independent verification. Missing/ambiguous objects, malformed messages, unavailable Git, encoding errors and limit failures are explicit.

`record_commits(work_id, commits, actor, request_id)` imports 1–20 concrete hashes for an In Progress code Task or Atomic. It reads the assigned Module worktree (or the standalone Atomic's own worktree); if repository_path is configured, both must share the same canonical common Git directory. Each source is validated before any report write. Reports are appended in requested order and deduplicated by work, round, common directory and full SHA. A new round requires explicit reimport; old reports are retained as history. Imported Result/Checks text fills the ordinary result/check_result fields, with level-two source headings rendered deeper to preserve native section boundaries. Existing field-length limits still apply. The tool never changes status.

`model::LocalGitReport` serializes `round` alongside the flattened `git::GitCommit` fields. `Meta.git_reports` stores ordered immutable history in the existing native attachment; absent fields default to an empty list for legacy records. `Meta::current_git_reports()` and issue context's top-level `git_reports` expose only the current round. Full snapshots, including original_message, remain readable without Git after history rewrites or checkout removal. The normal pending-write path persists snapshots before native description edits and resumes an identical request without re-reading Git. Imported current-round commits allow code Task completion or Atomic submission without commit_url. Manual commit links and non-code artifacts retain their existing path.

`reports::module_report(&Work, &[Work]) -> Result<ModuleReport>` is the pure shared Module composer. Module context exposes its result as `module_report`: summary, reported_checks, notes, tasks_done/tasks_total, excluded_count, source_commits, unfinished, excluded and pr_draft. Results are grouped by child with shared commit content emitted once; each source reference names all contributing work IDs. Current-round imports are used when present, otherwise manual/non-code result fields and artifact links are retained. Native Task statuses determine Done/total; Atomics are reported but not counted as Tasks. Canceled/Duplicate direct children are visible separately and counted in excluded_count. Unfinished work and old-round-only snapshots never count as completed results. Empty or fully excluded Modules may retain their existing manual summary/checks. Missing child metadata/status and native field-size overflow fail explicitly.

Module review readiness uses that same composer and still requires every child finished and a real pr_url. The In Review transition copies its derived summary/checks to native fields through the existing pending-write path, invalidating an old review when the content changes. No second manual report is required. pr_draft is Markdown text only; no PR is created or published. Review acceptance and the real merge report remain required for Module Done.

## Project entry

`list_items(type: team)` lists native teams with native pagination and no other filter, for a real `team_id` before `create_project` rather than a guessed internal ID. `list_items(type: project, repository_path: <absolute path>)` resolves that local checkout's canonical common Git directory (`git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir`, resolving symlinks) and returns every stored Project whose own recorded `repository_path` resolves to the same directory: the primary checkout and any of its linked worktrees match identically, since a linked worktree's common directory is the same physical location. An unknown or non-Git supplied path fails explicitly with `INVALID_REPOSITORY`, before any Project is read. Several Projects can legitimately share one checkout and are all returned. A Project whose own stored `repository_path` no longer resolves (moved or deleted checkout) is reported separately in `inaccessible_stored_checkouts`, never silently dropped from the result or turned into a fatal error for the rest of the lookup. `repository_path` cannot be combined with any other `list_items` filter. `get_context(type: project, detail: brief)` adds that Project's parsed `repository_path`/`repository_url`, native teams (id, name), the observed `updatedAt` version for the next guarded passport edit, and a `get_overview` route alongside its existing document routes.

## Priority views

`list_items` keeps native pagination by default. `order_by: "priority"` requires an issue, Project, and kind, and optionally scopes to one parent; omitted or null parent means Project root. The complete live sibling group is loaded within the normal page budget, filtered and sorted by priority (1, 2, 3, 4, then 0), native `prioritySortOrder`, and UUID. Its cursor binds the filters and last UUID, so subsequent pages are sorted after the whole group and reject changed filters or missing anchors. `priority` may filter a native priority value 0–4. Priority is advisory ordering and never changes transition conditions or starts work. `get_context` reports sorted peers in the same Project, parent and kind group.

`get_context` also accepts a native Linear URL as `url` (or `id`): the coordinated release contract covers Project, Issue, Document and ProjectUpdate permalinks with the type inferred and otherwise validated, while runtimes before that rollout resolve Issue URLs and every UUID reference. Optional `view: "lead"` or `"reviewer"`; a URL without a view defaults to lead. The role view adds the assigned checkout, relevant Epic requirements, priority-ordered children, persisted current-round Git reports, derived Module report, current formal review, open questions and document links. Document links include Project documents and documents attached to the current Issue or its Issue ancestors; the body is loaded only by an explicit document read. Archived links remain visible, with duplicate IDs removed. Legacy type/UUID calls retain their existing fields. Links select a view, never grant workflow authority. A missing or detached recorded child, or a direct child's pending/status drift, appears as an explicit discrepancy; derived Module counts are withheld until the native hierarchy is repaired.

`get_overview(project_id)` loads one complete Project work graph, then bounded native activity (up to 300 work items and 100 updates). It reports active Epics with every frozen Module, active standalone Modules, Atomics, retired work, open questions and items awaiting review. Task progress comes only from `ModuleReport`; a missing frozen Module, recorded child or other native drift fails explicitly. The assigned lead is a reference to a session, not a claim that its process is running. The response contains an unpublished Markdown ProjectUpdate draft. `save_project_update` may omit `body` on creation and compose this draft during its explicit write; the caller must still select `health` and `reason`. Retries of that creation read the native update by request ID before regenerating a draft. Edits require an explicit body for exact retry behavior. Neither overview reads nor draft generation publish an update.

Every overview includes an observation time. A compact snapshot over 256 KiB returns a full overview with a null cursor and explicit `baseline_unavailable`, without inventing an empty delta. Snapshot construction happens only in the overview read; generated ProjectUpdates do not require one. Otherwise the overview includes an opaque cursor. A later call with that cursor returns status, assignment, result, review and discussion changes plus a new cursor; an unchanged result has an empty `changes` array only after a valid comparison. The gateway retains at most 32 compact snapshots of up to 256 KiB each for 30 minutes. A restart, expiry, eviction, unknown cursor or cursor from another Project returns the full overview with `baseline_expired: true`; a first request without a cursor returns the full overview without an expiry flag. This process memory is only a comparison aid, never workflow storage. Reading an overview never writes to Linear or runs a watcher.

Machine data lives on one small native attachment per managed issue: kind, expected parent/project/status, known children, frozen membership, implementation/review round, current review, integration completion snapshot and any prepared write. The attachment is selected by its deterministic UUID, never by title or current placement. Native Duplicate merges transfer attachments to the original issue; `Attachment.originalIssue` preserves their originating issue and takes precedence over current `issue` when validating reads and writes. Each original issue retains its own distinct canonical record. Recorded children remain visible to guards if moved to a different native Project. No signatures or proof certificates are used. The attachment links back to the issue. Native dates/history remain available in Linear; MCP does not maintain a second time-in-status system.

## Epic composition

At the first `In Progress` transition, the Epic fixes its Module IDs, including an empty list. The list is never unlocked by reopening. Modules cannot subsequently be attached, created under it or detached through MCP. Canceling a Module preserves membership and history.

Atomics may be added to active Epics. A new out-of-scope Module belongs directly to Project and starts in Todo. It can start independently, or name `after_epic` and wait for that Epic's Done status. The orchestrator starts it explicitly.

## Transition conditions

Normal cycle: Backlog → Todo → In Progress → In Review → Done. Task skips In Review. Draft work may start directly from Backlog when ready. Returning to In Progress is the explicit rework path. Project has no work lifecycle through these tools.

| Kind | In Progress | In Review | Done |
|---|---|---|---|
| Epic | Business requirements, expected result, acceptance; freeze Module list | Children finished, business result recorded, current integration covering delivered Modules | Positive current review; orchestrator |
| Module | Parent Epic In Progress if present; waiting Epic Done; expected result, acceptance, lead, repo, branch, worktree, both contract fields | All Tasks/Atomics finished; PR, implementation result and checks | Positive current review and merge report; orchestrator |
| Task | Module In Progress; expected result, acceptance and local check | Unsupported | Result, checks, commit for code or artifact for non-code |
| Atomic | Parent work In Progress if present; executor, expected result, acceptance, local check; coding checkout (inherited under Module) | Result, checks, commit or non-code artifact | Positive current review; orchestrator |

Completed children may remain Done while parents are still In Progress. Canceled and Duplicate children do not contribute unfinished scope. Parent retirement requires all children to be terminal. Canceled requires a reason; Duplicate also requires an original-work link. No transition cascades to children.

Duplicate is a [system-managed Linear status](https://linear.app/docs/configuring-workflows). Its transition resolves `duplicate_of` to a native Issue and creates an `issueRelationCreate` relation with `type: duplicate`, the retiring issue as `issueId` and the original as `relatedIssueId`. It does not directly assign the reserved state. A retry checks the complete outgoing relation list, preserves a conflicting original link and confirms both relation and native status before finalizing the saved intent. Invalid issue links and self-links are rejected before preparing a new transition.

## Review and rework

`add_comment` writes a native Linear Comment on an Issue, Project or ProjectUpdate. Its `request_id` is the native comment ID, so an identical retry reads the created comment after an uncertain response. A reply's `parent_id` must belong to the same target. `get_comment` accepts a full UUID or a native Linear permalink and returns the comment, root and one native page of replies. Ordinary fragments contain a short comment hash; ProjectUpdate comments use short update and comment tokens. Lookup resolves the Project URL slug, searches only that Project's bounded native updates for a unique token match, then compares the complete native Comment URL. A changed Project or update URL cannot select another comment. `list_items(type: comment)` supports native cursors and target/parent filters. `resolve_comment` resolves or reopens a root thread through Linear's native operations. Comments do not change work status or act as review approval.

A `kind: "handoff"` comment on a managed Issue is stamped with that work's current round and revision at write time — the caller supplies only the checkpoint body. A read selects the newest handoff whose stamped round matches the work's *current* round as `handoff.current`; any other handoff (a different or superseded round) stays visible under `handoff.history`, never silently replaced or discarded. `revision_changed: true` on the current-round handoff means a content edit bumped the work's revision after that checkpoint was written, so its prose may already be stale relative to the current recorded content — a caller reading `handoff.current` should treat that flag as a prompt to check the actual current fields, not trust the checkpoint blindly.

Activity comments show Kind, Role and Actor on separate lines, with optional Session, Recipient and source links. A question requires a recipient. The typed ActivityRecord projection contains the native ID/URL/target/thread/times, content, and optional review details; ordinary unformatted comments read as notes. The current workflow attachment alone identifies a formal review, so an arbitrary comment saying “accepted” cannot approve work. Code commit imports add one deterministic progress comment per persisted current-round LocalGitReport. If the comment response is lost after the task result is saved, replay of the original import finishes the journal from that snapshot without rereading Git.

`save_project_update` creates or edits a native ProjectUpdate only by explicit call. The caller selects onTrack, atRisk or offTrack and supplies a visible author, health reason and body; no read publishes an update. Creation uses request_id as the native ID, so retrying an unknown outcome reads the existing update. Edits require id, project_id and the last observed updatedAt as expected_updated_at. A changed native update with a different timestamp blocks the edit instead of overwriting it. `get_context(type: project_update)` and `list_items(type: project_update)` return native health, URLs and typed activity records; lists retain native cursor pagination. A Project comment is still a separate Comment without health, and none of these operations changes Issue status.

`record_review` requires In Review and a Module, Atomic or Epic. It records a native comment with reviewer, summary, findings, artifact links and `accepted`/`changes_requested`. It never changes status. A Task is reviewed only within its Module.

Before creating a review comment, `Meta.pending_review` stores its normalized request, exact body, intended stamp and captured predecessor. Only that request may resume; completion checks the predecessor again. Historical repeats return the current decision without repointing it. A legacy comment whose save was interrupted is adopted only for a clean current In Review stamp; with a predecessor, its native creation time must be strictly newer. Equal or unavailable times conflict. Readers accept attachment schemas 2 and 3; new ordinary work remains schema 2, storing a review intent upgrades to 3, and later writes never downgrade 3. Older schema-two runtimes reject schema 3. Project creation replay reads every native team page and requires exactly the requested single team.

The orchestrator returns work to In Progress after changes are requested. A new work round clears its current results/checks/artifacts and current review. Earlier native reports and history remain. New outputs and a new review are required. Editing reviewed content requires reopening; a Module's `merge_report` can be added after positive review without invalidating it.

Reopening In Review/Done work validates and adopts the current native description before start guards. Unknown sections and literal code stay exact; new-round outputs are cleared from that adopted source, and the round/revision changes once. Structural drift and invalid fields still block. Explicit active description adoption through `fields: {}` invalidates content identity; title/priority or unchanged-parent presentation edits keep their existing identity. Changing a child's status to Canceled/Duplicate requires an In Progress parent without drift, just as closure does.

PR links and merge facts remain trusted agent reports. MCP reads local commits but does not contact a remote host to verify a PR or merge. A local repository does not replace the Module's real PR, review or merge requirements. Shared bearer clients are trusted; reported roles are workflow attribution, not separate authorization principals.

## Integration Atomic

The orchestrator creates an Atomic with `work_type: integration` under an Epic or directly under Project. It names at least two Modules, interaction scenarios, environment, expected outcome and local check. Epic integration uses that Epic's Modules.

Start requires participating Modules Done with merge reports. The Atomic stores their work-round/content/completion identities. It tests combined behavior and supplies an artifact report; no new commit is needed if it only runs checks. Its report is reviewed normally.

A changed or reopened Module invalidates earlier integration. Repeat the Atomic explicitly by returning it to In Progress, running its scenarios again and submitting new results/review. A stale integration already In Progress can explicitly restart in that same status with a fresh round. Participating Modules must remain free of native discrepancies through integration review and closure. Epics with multiple delivered Modules require current successful integration coverage before final review.

## Provider module seams

`Gateway` grows through small child modules under `src/gateway/`, not through
unbounded growth of `gateway.rs` itself. A child module declares its own
`impl Gateway { pub(super) async fn ... }` blocks; ordinary Rust module-tree
visibility already lets it call `gateway.rs`'s private helpers (`resolve`,
`project`, `store`, `with_guidance`, …) without those helpers becoming public.
`gateway.rs` only adds the one-line `mod <name>;` declaration and, where a new
public tool needs it, one arm in `dispatch()`. `src/gateway/documents.rs`
holds the `save_document` handler; `src/gateway/artifacts.rs` holds
`upload_file`/`list_files`/`get_file`, reusing the same seam.

The tool contract is schema-first: `schemas/tools.json` is edited directly,
embedded by `src/catalog.rs`, and served by discovery. There is no catalogue
generator. `cargo xtask contract check` compares the committed schema with
the embedded catalogue, dispatch vocabulary and real-binary MCP discovery.
Contract and protocol xtask aliases also run the raw HTTP/stdio revision,
tool-call and EOF regressions; the full workspace gate includes the same suite.
Provider changes land in their Rust child modules, with coordinated edits to
the authoritative schema, GraphQL operations and fixtures when required.
Presentation templates in `assets/mcp/*.j2` remain embedded application assets.

## Document and file provider contract

`save_document`/`get_context(type: document)` keep the existing metadata
(`id, title, url, content, updatedAt, archivedAt, hiddenAt, project, issue`)
and existing create semantics (`request_id` as native ID, exactly one Project
or Issue parent; a new Document rejects `section`/`expected_updated_at`, which
have no prior state to guard). Editing an existing Document is guarded:
`content` without `section` replaces the whole body; `section` is a unique
heading text (not a regex), valid only together with `content`, and
`save_document(id, section, content)` replaces only that section's body,
keeping its heading and every byte outside its range — a missing or ambiguous
heading fails before any write. `hidden: bool` maps to native `hiddenAt`
(now/null) and only writes when the state actually changes; `project_id`/
`issue_id` rebind to exactly one new parent, explicitly clearing the other. A
proposed state already equal to native state confirms `replayed: true` with
no write, even after a restart; otherwise a missing `expected_updated_at` is a
distinct `PRECONDITION_REQUIRED` fault naming the `get_context` route, a stale
one is `PENDING_CONFLICT`, and the write happens once with its result
confirmed before being returned. `get_context(type: document, section: ...)`
returns that section's body as `content` plus `section: {heading, index,
count}` and a route back to the whole document; the response is otherwise the
normal Document envelope. A document is current iff both `archivedAt` and
`hiddenAt` are null. `list_items(type: document)` keeps the plain native page
(optionally scoped by `project_id`); `search(type: document)` additionally
scopes to a Project (a Document attached to it directly, or to one of its
Issues), defaults to 10 results and never returns more than 25 regardless of
`first`, applies `include_archived` to both archived and hidden material
against one native page, and each result row carries title, url, owning
Project/Issue, updated time, currentness and a short honestly-sourced
snippet — the literal matched title/content substring when one exists, a
plain content preview marked `"semantic"` otherwise, never a fabricated
literal match. A native page can hold fewer or more real matches than it
returned, including zero, while `pageInfo.hasNextPage` still promises more to
check; that filtered-page state is reported explicitly, never presented as an
exhausted, empty search.

Search uses Linear's native ranking and indexing; it does not guarantee
exhaustive substring retrieval or immediate discovery of a newly written
opaque token. Use a known Document URL with `get_context` for exact retrieval.

File operations are three focused tools: `upload_file` reads one local file
(host-side absolute path, bounded to 10,000,000 bytes), reserves a
deterministic native attachment ID per issue/request, and compares replay
intent (filename, content type, size, digest, title, note) before treating a
retry as identical; changed intent is `REQUEST_CONFLICT`. `list_files` returns
only user artifacts for one work item, excluding internal workflow
attachments. `get_file` resolves and validates artifact ownership/type,
downloads through the canonical authenticated asset URL while verifying the
bytes against the digest recorded at upload time, writes through a sibling
temporary file, and never silently overwrites a different existing file at
the same destination (`FILE_EXISTS` on conflict, `replayed: true` only for
byte-identical content). None of these three tools returns binary content, a
signed URL or a secret in its text response; artifact attachments live in
their own `metadata.artifact` namespace, fully separate from the canonical
`metadata.workflow` state record.

## Manual changes and failures

Every guarded operation reads fresh Linear state. Status, parent/project, type-label, completion and frozen-membership inconsistencies are reported and block forward progress. Reads do not fix state. Restore structural changes explicitly in Linear; use the documented reopen/edit paths for state/content repair.

Exactly one loopback gateway serializes requests. Stdio clients share it. Native writes across an issue and its attachment are not a distributed transaction: issue edits/transitions persist a prepared update and source snapshot before the native mutation and finalize only after the returned fields match the target. A cold gateway resumes only on an identical explicit request. It finalizes an already applied target, retries an unchanged source, or rejects conflicting native edits without overwriting them.

The service does not protect against a malicious agent editing its native records, launch agents, schedule work, create integration automatically or migrate v1 pilot data.
